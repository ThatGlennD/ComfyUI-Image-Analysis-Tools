# Image Analysis Toolkit

The Image Analysis Toolkit is a suite of custom ComfyUI nodes built to evaluate and diagnose the technical qualities of images—especially those generated by AI models. Rather than creating visuals, these tools measure them, offering precise insights into sharpness, noise, exposure, color balance, and more.

Whether you’re tuning generation parameters, comparing model outputs, or building automated pipelines for quality assurance, this toolkit helps you make decisions grounded in data—not guesswork.

Each node focuses on a specific dimension of image quality and returns interpretable outputs that can be visualized, logged, or used downstream for filtering and refinement.
